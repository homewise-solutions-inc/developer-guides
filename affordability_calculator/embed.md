# Embed Homewise Affordability Calculator
Thank you for partnering with Homewise!

This guide covers the steps to embed Homewise Affordability calculator into your website.

## Installation

### Step 1
Complete [partner configuration](../partner/configuration.md).

### Step 2
Paste following line right after the `homewise` object. This loads the widget embed script.

```

#### Example
```html
<script>
  var homewise = {
    partner: {
      type: "p",
      code: "foo",
      segment: "bar"
    }
  };
</script>
<script src="https://widgets.thinkhomewise.com/lib/com-affordability-calculator/1.3/embed.js"></script>
```

#### Versions
Homewise will release versions time to time introducing new features and bug fixes. We recommend that you use the latest 
version of embed script by changing the version number (e.g `/1.3/embed.js`). Following table shows available versions.

default object.
