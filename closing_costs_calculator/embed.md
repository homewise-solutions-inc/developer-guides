<script>
  var homewise = {
    partner: {
      type: "p",
      code: "partner_code_goes_here",
      segment: "optional_segment_goes_here"
    }
  };
</script>
<script src="https://widgets.thinkhomewise.com/lib/com-closing-costs-calculator/1.2/embed.js"></script>
```

#### Versions
Homewise will release versions with new features and bug fixes. We recommend that you use the latest 
version of embed script by changing the version number (e.g `/1.2/embed.js`). Following table shows available versions.
