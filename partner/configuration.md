### Step 2
1. Log into your partner dashboard.
2. Copy the partner code.

### Step 3
Paste the following code somewhere near top of the page. Right before `</head>` tag or right after `<body>` tag is 
recommended. Fill it with correct values. This adds Homewise default configuration matching your unique partner details.

> :warning: Completing this step with correct values is crucial. Please refer to browser's console for errors.

```html
<script>
  var homewise = {
    partner: {
      type: <string>,
      code: <string>,
      segment: <string>
    }
  };
</script>
```

#### Reference
| Property   | Required | Accepted Values               | Default  |
|------------|:--------:|-------------------------------|----------|
| `type`     |    Y     | `p`, `a`, `r`                 | `null`   |
| `code`     |    Y     | `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_` | `null`   |
| `segment`  |    N     | `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_` | `null`   |

##### Notes
* `type` - Your partner type. Partner (`p`), Advisor (`a`) or Realtor (`r`).
* `code` - Partner code copied from your partner dashboard _or_ a code Homewise generated for you.
* `segment` - Value to associate with the collected mortgage application. Visible in the dashboard (or custom reports). 
  * _E.g. You built 2 pages with Homewise app embedded. One page is for Ontario and one page is for Alberta. You can use
    `ontario` and `alberta` as segment values. This will allow us segment apps differently in reports._

#### Example
```html
<script>
  var homewise = {
    partner: {
      type: "p",
      code: "partner_code_goes_here",
      segment: "optional_segment_goes_here"
    }
  };
</script>
```
